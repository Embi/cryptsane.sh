A rather insane (in its implementation) Bash TUI tool that attempts to make 
working with GnuPG and YubiKey a bit more sane. The tool essentially implements
all suggestions from the [YubiKey-Guide](https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide)
and adds some additional functionality.

## Overview
Core usage example:
1. Mount a [Vault](#vault).
2. Generate an [OpenPGP Identity](#openpgp-identity).
3. Export the OpenPGP Identity to the Vault.
4. Move the subkeys to a YubiKey.
5. Exit.

#### Vault
A block device with two partitions: `vault-secret` and `vault-public`.
The `vault-secret` partition is LUKS-encrypted and intended for storing private keys
(the certification key and, optionally, the subkeys). The `vault-public`
partition is used for storing public keys.

#### OpenPGP Identity
Each `OpenPGP Identity` represents at least one `User Identity` 
(one primary UID and, optionally, `N` additional UIDs) and exactly five keys: a key pair
(a `public` key and a secret `certification` key) and
three `subkeys` (a `signature` key, an `authentication` key and an `encryption` key). 
The `subkeys` are then used for the day-to-day cryptographic operations.
The`Certification` key is only used to issue the `sub-keys` and should
never come in contact with an online system. `Public` key holds all public information
about the `OpenPGP Identity` (e.g, UIDs, fingerprints...)

#### User Identity
Typically in the form of `Name <email>` (e.g., `John Doe <doe@example.com>`).


## Requirements

Software:
- `Bash 4+` 
- `Gum 0.15+`
- `GnuPG 2.4+`
- `yubikey-manager 5.1+`
- `pcsclite`
- `cryptsetup`
- `ccid`
- `less`

Hardware:
- YubiKey 5
- USB stick(s) (100MB used for the secret partition, rest for the public partition)

## How to run

### Arch Linux
1. Install necessary packages.
```bash
pacman -S gum gnupg yubikey-manager ccid pcsclite cryptsetup less
```

2. Start and enable `pcscd`.
```bash
systemctl start pcscd
systemctl enable pcscd
```

3. Disable the integrated CCID driver in GnuPG's `scdaemon` (smart card daemon).
   Instead, we will use access through the `pcscd` daemon.

```bash
echo "disable-ccid" >> ~/.gnupg/scdaemon.conf
gpgconf --kill gpg-agent
```

4. Make sure YubiKey is accessible via `yubikey-manager` and also via `gpg`.

```console

5. Clone the repository and run the script
```console
$ ./cryptsane -h
Usage: cryptsane [OPTIONS]

Description:
  Cryptsane is a TUI tool for managing OpenPGP/GnuPG/YubiKey madness. 
  The tools allows you to:
  - Create an OpenPGP Identity (key pair + subkeys + UIDs).
  - Create a Vault (a USB block device with one LUKS-encrypted and one unencrypted
    partition)
  - Export an OpenPGP Identity to a Vault.
  - Import an OpenPGP Identity from a Vault
  - Move subkeys to a YubiKey.
  - Rotate subkeys (revoke existing and generate new ones)
  - Some other usefull stuff

Options:
  -h, --help       Show this help message and exit.
  -p, --private    Run in private mode (root privileges required).

Examples:
  cryptsane
  cryptsane -p
```

### Docker (WIP/poorly tested)
It is also possible to run the tool as a Docker container. However, accessing
USB sticks (vault devices) can be somewhat clunkyâ€”the device must be plugged
in before the containerized TUI is launched, otherwise the tool will not be
able to detect it. You should also expect some issues with permissions, especially
when running it in user mode.

1. Build the docker image.
```Console
$ ./build-cryptsane-docker 
```

2. Run the tool.
```Console
$ ./cryptsane-docker -h
Usage: cryptsane-docker [OPTIONS]

## Configuration

All default configuration values are taken from the
[Yubikey-Guide](https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide). Refer to the guide for
explanations.

| env variable                  | default value | description | 
|:------------------------------|:--------------|:------------|
| `CRYPTSANE_KEY_TYPE`          | rsa4096       |[Key](https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide?tab=readme-ov-file#key) |
| `CRYPTSANE_SUBKEY_EXPIRATION` | 2y            |[Expiration](https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide?tab=readme-ov-file#expiration) |
| `CRYPTSANE_VAULT_FS`          | ext2          |[Vault FS](https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide?tab=readme-ov-file#expiration). Only `ext2` was tested with this tool. |


## Run Modes

The tool can be run in two modes: `private` and `user`. `Private` mode is
intended for use on a single-user offline (ideally air-gapped) device, while
`user` mode is intended to be run on your regular online workstation.

### Private mode
```
sudo ./cryptsane --private
```
Allows you to:
 - Create a new vault.
 - Create, edit, import, or export an OpenPGP Identity.
 - Revoke and generate new subkeys for an OpenPGP Identity.
 - Move subkeys to a YubiKey.

### User mode
```bash
./cryptsane
```
Allows you to:
 - Import an OpenPGP Identity's public key from the `vault-public` partition to your
   `GNUPGHOME`.
 - Select an existing OpenPGP Identity from your `GNUPGHOME`.
 - Use the OpenPGP Identity, combined with subkeys stored on a YubiKey, for
   cryptographic operations.
